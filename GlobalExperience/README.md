### Inclusion & Equity
My Global experience is wide and multi-variate. Though my study abroad experience was cut short and nullified by COVID-19 and my decision to pursue Student Body President, I still immersed myself throughout the cultures already existing at DU and Denver as a whole. 

### Multi-departmental 

Working together with a varying array of departments at DU including but not limited to Diversity & Inclusive Excellence, Office of Equal Opportunity and Title IX, Student Affairs, Athletics, Facilities, and the Chancellorâ€™s office, I pulled together multiple departments to pursue varying projects. Within my own executive branch, I oversaw the creation of our Student Advocacy Branch who immediately connected with Title IX, Campus Safety, and relevant student organizations to facilitate discussions of equity and inclusion, safety, preventative measures, and intercultural connections. 

Throughout this space I realized the vital importance of other, unique perspectives to help develop not only my own world view, but also of those around me. Diverse thought and opinion are vital towards making critical and ethical decisions. Without conflicting opinions or relevant discussion, there is a lack of critical thought and purposeful decisions. In these spaces of engaging with multiple departments, cultures, and ideas, the skill of an open mind is a crucial towards creating an inclusive community and thought.
