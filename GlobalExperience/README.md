# Global and Inclusive Competence

### Inclusion & Equity
My Global experience is wide and multi-variate. Though my study abroad experience was cut short and nullified by COVID-19 and my decision to pursue Student Body President, I still immersed myself throughout the cultures already existing at DU and Denver as a whole. 

### Multi-departmental 

Working together with a varying array of departments at DU including but not limited to Diversity & Inclusive Excellence, Office of Equal Opportunity and Title IX, Student Affairs, Athletics, Facilities, and the Chancellor’s office, I pulled together multiple departments to pursue varying projects. Within my own executive branch, I oversaw the creation of our Student Advocacy Branch who immediately connected with Title IX, Campus Safety, and relevant student organizations to facilitate discussions of equity and inclusion, safety, preventative measures, and intercultural connections. 

Throughout this space I realized the vital importance of other, unique perspectives to help develop not only my own world view, but also of those around me. Diverse thought and opinion are vital towards making critical and ethical decisions. Without conflicting opinions or relevant discussion, there is a lack of critical thought and purposeful decisions. In these spaces of engaging with multiple departments, cultures, and ideas, the skill of an open mind is a crucial towards creating an inclusive community and thought. 

 
### Healthy Masculinities

Together with a working group of professionals all over campus, we discussed tangible outcomes for elevating a campus culture of empathy, respect, and safety. The Healthy Masculinities work entailed creating engagement opportunities and a course directed towards male identifying students at DU. The intention of this program is meant to address questions surrounding identity, emotional intelligence, confidence, and awareness. All in efforts to combat “toxic” masculinity or a better phrase, “unhealthy” masculinity.

In this process, I have been able to reflect on my own identity and persona with intention of change—an intention to learn and grow. I only hope that with the implementation of this project, other individuals will be able to reflect, recover, and grow as well. With success seen on other campuses, I am confident that the Healthy Masculinities program will bolster the DU community and its purpose.
