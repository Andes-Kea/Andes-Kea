### Who Am I
Always curious, I entered my college career with wide, longing eyes. Focused on my own experiential learning, growth, and progress, DU provided a perfect continued foundation for developing myself. From my technical learning within the fields of analytics, computer science, and mathematics, combined with my experiential learning and leadership through Undergraduate Student Government, my core competencies have been cultured and challenged. Through my constant curiosity, I took every opportunity to develop my world view and perspective.

With an extensive background in leadership, I have built relationships all throughout my life. Focusing on developing my own skillset while giving back to my community, I pursued the role of Undergraduate Student Body President at DU. In this position, I have developed a skillset in how to prioritize, organize, and learn from mistakes all while balancing my pursuit of a degree in Business Information and Analytics and minors in Computer Science and Mathematics.
