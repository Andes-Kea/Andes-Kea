### Who Am I
Hi there, welcome to my portfolio! My name is Keanan Anderson. I‚Äôm from a small town called Pagosa Springs, CO and ventured up north to the University of Denver (DU) in search of a higher calling. I am currently pursuing a degree in Business Information and Analytics with minors in Computer Science and Mathematics and an intended graduation date of June 2022. I currently hold the honor and the position of DU‚Äôs Undergraduate Student Body President, fulfilling the student's priorities. 

I am an incredibly curious mind, always looking to challenge myself in any way possible. From my technical learning within the fields of analytics, computer science, and mathematics, combined with my experiential learning and leadership through Undergraduate Student Government, my core competencies have been cultured and challenged. 

When I‚Äôm not in class, doing homework, or attending meetings, I can be found picking up a variety of hobbies to which they change often. Here are some activities that have recently piqued my interest:
-	Reading Sophist Philosophy
-	Climbing / Bouldering
-	Card Tricks
-	Acoustic Guitar
-	Smash Brothers Ultimate (Random Main)

### Personal Note
All aspects of my college career have, especially after taking a larger leadership role, have incorporated critical thinking and ethical practices. It is never something I am or will be perfect at, but as Maya Angelou said, 

‚ÄúDo the best you can until you know better. Then when you know better, do better.‚Äù

I have taken this quote to heart and reflect on it nearly daily. I believe it is incredibly crucial to give the benefit of the doubt in order to give the largest opportunity for growth. During my time at DU, I have been able to reflect, recognize, and reconcile with decisions that I have made, whether bad or good, or just grey. I am now able to operate with more confidence entering the next chapter of my life and I have DU and its opportunities to thank for it.
