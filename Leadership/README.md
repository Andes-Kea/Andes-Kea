During the height of the COVID-19 Pandemic, as with everything in the world, problem areas were illuminated and heightened. We began seeing the repercussions everywhere, and my eyes were focused at the University of Denver. With a mental health crisis on the rise, sustainability initiatives on the top of everyone’s tongue and a recent shift to a more inclusive, 4-Dimensional Model, these three pillars spurred my motivation for pursuing the role. 

In this role I, alongside my incredible team of fellow Undergraduate Students, have worked side by side to elevate the presence of USG and foster a deeper, more comprehensive student engagement plan. In the first two months alone, USG’s Instagram page increased by 200% after a intensive marketing plan. Planned student town halls 
Funding structures are also incredibly important and relevant to the student engagement. As President, I have aided in overseeing USG’s one million dollar budget and have advocated heavily to increase this amount. Through working with administration, I aided in approving a fee increase while also increasing student funding initiatives. 

Within this position as President I have been able to reflect, analyze, and truly curate a notion of respect for any form of leadership.
