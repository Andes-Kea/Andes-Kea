### Undergraduate Student Government (USG)

My role as the [President of the Undergraduate Student Body](https://duclarion.com/2021/04/keanan-anderson-and-mason-estes-run-for-usg-president-and-vice-president/) is to fulfill the priorities of the student body through working across departments, engaging with constituents, and overseeing the operations of USG. 
A list including a sample of my responsibilities is included below:
-	Communicate directly with the Chancellor, Provost, VC of Student Affairs, and other relevant administrators as needed.
-	Present in front of the Board of Trustees on a quarterly basis.
-	Select and appoint members to the Executive Branch as well as any missing positions within the Legislative and or Judicial Branch.
-	Sign off on legislation passed by the USG Senate.
-	Aid in allocating and overseeing USG’s one-million-dollar budget.
-	Represent the student body in all interactions.

### Leading During COVID-19

Through working with the DU COVID Coordinator, I helped make relevant, timely decisions on what protective steps should be implemented for DU students. I was able to see first hand the incredibly hard working members of the DU community dedicated towards keeping our community safe. I’m honored to have lent even a small hand during times of struggle. With mask mandates, vaccination requirements, testing requirements, and a variety of other crucial information, I worked with USG to disseminate information to the student body. Also, during the peak of the pandemic (2019-2021), I wrote a resolution through USG to promote the implementation of a Pass Fail Option which was ultimately received and implemented by the University. This resolution highlighted the unique struggles that COVID-19 presented for students and aided in giving a form of relief during incredibly stressful times. 

I found it vital to maintain connections, no matter how difficult, during the pandemic. The connections we make with each other are what allow us to grow, learn, recover, and thrive. Taking away those connection aspects were difficult for everyone, that is why I also worked alongside DU Programming Board (DUPB)—an organization funded by USG focused around student engagement events—to create unique programs that allow for engagement from all students while also in a safe, and aware manner. 

### Board of Trustees

One of the many responsibilities of the Undergraduate Student Body President is to present in front of the Board of Trustees on a relevant topic an issue facing students. As I approached this presentation, I had to prioritize a singular topic out of the countless issues facing students. My topic of choice: Student Mental Health and Wellbeing. Due to its incredibly pertinent nature coming out of COVID-19, and a rise in mental health issues, lack of access, and overall decrease in wellbeing, I felt it my responsibility to advocate for the students of DU. I presented using survey data from a Campus Climate Survey conducted in 2020 and advocated for increased funding for DU’s Health and Counseling Center (HCC), localized therapy care, representation in counselors and services, education of students, and re-evaluation of the quarter system. 
From this presentation, I successfully increased the funding being allocated to the HCC and increased efforts of hiring and retaining a more diverse staff of counselors and therapists.

### President


During the height of the COVID-19 Pandemic, as with everything in the world, problem areas were illuminated and heightened. We began seeing the repercussions everywhere, and my eyes were focused at the University of Denver. With a mental health crisis on the rise, sustainability initiatives on the top of everyone’s tongue and a recent shift to a more inclusive, 4-Dimensional Model, these three pillars spurred my motivation for pursuing the role. 

In this role I, alongside my incredible team of fellow Undergraduate Students, have worked side by side to elevate the presence of USG and foster a deeper, more comprehensive student engagement plan. In the first two months alone, USG’s Instagram page increased by 200% after a intensive marketing plan. Planned student town halls 
Funding structures are also incredibly important and relevant to the student engagement. As President, I have aided in overseeing USG’s one million dollar budget and have advocated heavily to increase this amount. Through working with administration, I aided in approving a fee increase while also increasing student funding initiatives. 

Within this position as President I have been able to reflect, analyze, and truly curate a notion of respect for any form of leadership. 

### Sustainability

During my term, the Chancellor of the University of Denver announced the commitment for DU to become Carbon Neutral by 2030 during his Inauguration. This set in to motion a Carbon Neutrality Task Force to which I became an active member of. With the mission of researching, and proposing a set plan for implementing the goal, I have seen on-hand the creation, deliberation, and project proposals for a large scale project. As one of the only student representatives sitting on the task force, I provided a necessary perspective and creative insights into activating the community. Through using other student organizations and recommending the elevation of the sustainability officer to reside under the Chancellor’s cabinet in DU’s hierarchy, the overall implementation of sustainable practices are now more cohesive and collective.

### Student Wellness & Engagement

Together alongside the Office of Equal Opportunity and Title IX and the HCC, I aided in the construction of a Campus Climate Survey (Released March 2022) to target specifically student’s interactions with issues surrounding Title IX processes, abuse, mental health, and overall wellness. In these interactions, I helped facilitate the student perspective and also used my background in creating and conducting surveys to make each question purposeful and insightful. This data set will be vital in peering in to the highs and lows of DU and target the problem areas. With better data comes better results, and better results lead towards a better DU.

I worked directly with the Director of Campus Safety to promote preventative measures towards drugging and spiking of drinks. Through a mass purchase of NightCap® covers, DU Campus Safety and USG dispersed over 700 NightCaps® and outreached to over 2,000 students in protective measures. This initiative was also in tandem with educational materials to insure the full understanding of the scale and scope of the problem.
