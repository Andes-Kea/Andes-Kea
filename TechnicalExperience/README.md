The University of Denver developed my technical skills through a variety of unique and challenging courses. From Database Management Systems Sequence to Algorithms and Data Structures, I have been educated in a variety of hard skills and applications.

- Coding: Java, Python, VBA, SQL
-	Data Visualization: Power BI, Tableau, Visio, (Python packages of Seaborn, Matplotlib)
-	Microsoft: Excel, Access, Word, PowerPoint, Teams
-	Analysis Tools: SPSS Modeler, JMP, Power Pivot


### SSMS / SQL Server

Withing my curriculum for Business Information and Analytics, I built a database surrounding the United States Forest Service and their project operations. Using Mockaroo, I filled my data-set with “fake” data to provide a better structure and avoid dirty data. From this process, I initially created an ERD diagram covering the overall structure of the database.

In this year long course project, my first class covered Visio, Microsoft Access, basic SQL querying, and database construction. As seen below, my ERD Diagram, Access project, and some of my SQL queries. 
For the second stage, the class focused on building the database through SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS), and Visual Studio. Imaged below are those reports. I have also included

### Python

Using a multitude of python packages, I put together the dream team of fantasy hockey. Using the average points per game per player for the predicting variable, I constructed constraints around it including: team size, positions, average salaries, teams, and variety.

Here are the outputted teams of the model. Together they represent the Predicted (Left) and Actual (Right). Through this result I concluded that my simple restraints that I proposed limited the validity of the full scope of the project and if I was to construct a more successful, more accurate team, I would need to take a deeper dive into sports analytics.

### Tableau

### JMP

### Java

Within Java, I constructed my own version of snake using StdDraw. Through object oriented programming I realized how to implement....

### Power BI
A culmination of my year long USFS database project, my Power BI exemplifies a variety of data visualization skills alonside a honed database. Below is my finalized Power BI interactive dashboard:
