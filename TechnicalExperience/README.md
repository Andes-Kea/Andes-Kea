The University of Denver developed my technical skills through a variety of unique and challenging courses. From my course sequence of Database Management Systems to Algorithms and Data Structures, I have been educated in a variety of hard skills and applications.

- Coding: Java, Python, VBA, SQL
-	Data Visualization: Power BI, Tableau, Visio, (Python packages of Seaborn, Matplotlib)
-	Microsoft: Excel, Access, Word, PowerPoint, Teams
-	Analysis Tools: SPSS Modeler, JMP, Power Pivot

### Database Management Systems

In my Database Management Sequence I started off constructing a mock-database for the United States Forest Service (USFS) and their project management. This sequence covered the database lifecycle, from creation to visualization to results. In each phase of the sequence I continued to add new skills to my palette. I began with creating ERD diagrams within Visio and then quickly ramped up the pace to working with Microsoft Access and pieces of SQL querying (Both ERD & Access Reports are seen below)

My next phase focused primarily on SSMS, VBA, and Visual Studio, upgrading  my existing database to new capabilities. Through implementing SQL on SQL Server, I reconstructed my reports and created unique queries for answering business decisions. Portions of the SQL code are seen below.

The final culmination of this sequence ended in heightening my understanding of all the prior applications and rounding it out with Power BI as a final dashboard. It was an incredibly valuable opportunity to see this database come to fruition throughout each quarter to be finalized in a singular, incredible visual. My final dashboard for the USFS project is seen below.

### Python

Using a multitude of python packages, I put together the dream team of fantasy hockey. Using the average points per game per player for the predicting variable, I constructed constraints around it including: team size, positions, average salaries, teams, and variety.

Here are the outputted teams of the model. Together they represent the Predicted (Left) and Actual (Right). Through this result I concluded that my simple restraints that I proposed limited the validity of the full scope of the project and if I was to construct a more successful, more accurate team, I would need to take a deeper dive into sports analytics.

### Tableau

### Silicon Valley Travel Course

One incredible class I had the privilege of taking was that of the Silicon Valley travel course. For this class, I was able to take a deep dive into companies in the Silicon Valley area using data analytics within their operations. Alongside my class, I was able to meet with companies such as Charles Schwab, Microsoft, Snowflake, Visa, Levi Jeans, and even Leviâ€™s Stadium. In each company I was able to see firsthand the impact that analytics was making within the business world. It opened new possibilities in my mind for what analytics can accomplish and where I can foray into with my career. Below are some of my favorite photos of the trip.
